Hi! I am a 4th year Ecosystem Sciences Student at CSU where I also obtained my minor in Entomology and Zoology. During my first year of undergrad, I got involved in the Biology Teaching Collections where I now hold a position as Personal Relations Officer for our newly founded club. I have experience in RStudio, data basing, specimen prep and preservation, community outreach, and leadership.
